        "para1":"Yala combines a strict nature reserve with a national park. Divided into 5 blocks, the park has a protected area of nearly 130,000 hectares of land consisting of light forests, scrubs, grasslands, tanks and lagoons. Two blocks are currently opened to the public.",
        "para2":"Situated in Sri Lanka's south-east hugging the panoramic Indian Ocean, Yala was initially used as a hunting ground for the elite under British rule. Yala is home to 44 varieties of mammal and 215 bird species. Among its more famous residents are the world's biggest concentration of leopards, majestic elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, peacocks, and crocodiles. The best time to visit Yala is between February and July when the water levels of the park are quite low, bringing animals into the open."

        "para3":"Yala is one of Sri Lanka's oldest national parks and was designated a wildlife sanctuary as far back as 1900 though it wasn't until 1938 that it was established as a national park. Right in the heart of Yala sits the Buddhist temple Sithulpawa, and this former monastery is thought to date back 2,000 years. At one time, the monastery is thought to have housed 12,000 inhabitants, and today, it remains an important temple visited by pilgrims across Sri Lanka. Other significant cultural sites in the vicinity include Kataragama and Magul Maha Vihara."

        "para4":"Yala comprises five blocks, and while most game drives take place in Block I, game drives can and do occur in other blocks within the reserve. This is much more likely in September and October when Block I is often closed to visitors for around six weeks to allow animals unrestricted freedom of movement.",
        "para5":"Chena Huts is very conveniently located near the main Palutapana entrance of Yala, and it takes just minutes to reach the ticket desk from the hotel. Once inside, the network of tracks within the reserve are extensive, and our drivers are experienced in seeking out some of the more off-beat areas that avoid the crowds.",
